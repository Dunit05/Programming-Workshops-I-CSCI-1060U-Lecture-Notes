# Programming-Workshops-I-CSCI-1060U-Lecture-Notes

Here you will find all the in-class lecture code that we go over. This repository is a comprehensive collection of code examples, projects, and exercises designed to complement the material covered in the intro to Programming Workshop I lectures.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains folders labeled by `date (name)` by default, where:

- `Notes`: the folder contains the days lecture notes, with an executable C++ files `index.cpp` & `index.exe`.
- `Exercises`: the folder contains the days exercises, with an executable C++ files `(exerciseName).cpp` & `(exerciseName).exe`.

## Getting Started

Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your machine. If you are using Windows, you can use [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/) or [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/). If you are using Linux or MacOS, you can use [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/).
