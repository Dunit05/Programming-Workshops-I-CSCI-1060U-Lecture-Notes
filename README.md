## Folder Structure

The workspace contains folders labeled by `date (name)` by default, where there are executable c++ code in `index.cpp` & `index.exe` files.

## Getting Started

Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your machine. If you are using Windows, you can use [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/) or [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/). If you are using Linux or MacOS, you can use [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/).
